This is a project I started to get more comfortable with the Python programming language.

I started with a small linear algebra library with simple functions such as naive matrix multiplication. Then, I extended it to functions for basis manipulations, e.g. functions to find the basis vectors of intersections and unions of vector spaces and functions for reducing a spanning set to a basis using Gaussian elimination. Then, I implemented QR factorization that I read about on wikipedia, and finally, added a function to find eigenvectors of square matrices using power iteration. Finally, I implemented Jordan blocks using the Jordan chains.

Then, I became interested in the integer factorization problem, after which I started studying prime verification and factorization algorithms such as Miller-Rabin. The classical part of shorâ€™s algorithm is also included. 

Out of curiosity, I have also implemented other functions for mathematical computations such as rsa and miller-rabin ciphers, continued fractions reduction and iterative root finding, gibbs sampling and data clustering.
